The GAIA TAP Client lib by ESDC
===============================

This fork of the GACS (GAIA Archive Core System) Table Access Protocol client (TAP client) library by
the ESAC Science Data Centre (ESDC) adds
Maven support to build their most recently tagged source release (2017-05-26).

The upstream repo is using a non-standard tagging strategy wherein tags correspond to directories each containing
full copies of the code. Therefore the pom.xml file directly 
references the most recent of these directories `libs/java/tags/gaia-tapplus-access-lib-0.2_20170526`.

The artifact built is `GacsConnection-0.2.jar`.
