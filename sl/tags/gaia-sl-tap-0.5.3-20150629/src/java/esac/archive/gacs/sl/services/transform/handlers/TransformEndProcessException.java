 * This class is used to specify an end of processing.<br/>
 * When the user specifies a page size (i.e. a number of rows to dump) it is necessary to tell the parser to stop processing the data.
 * Nevertheless, parsers do not have a method to request to stop processing.
 * This exception is raised by the handlers so the high level functionality can determine whether a real exception has been raised or
 * a stop processing is requested.
